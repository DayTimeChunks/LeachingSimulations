    "# Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A dissipation model was developed at the microcosm scale to estimate pesticide component dissipation in top-soil, i.e. degradation and leaching during infiltration. Partitioning between rainfall and runoff was determined using the Green-Ampt method (Green and Ampt, 1911; Mein and Larson, 1973). This simplification of the Richards equation (Richards, 1931) simulates overland flow when rainfall intensity overcomes the soil infiltration capacity. The retention and release of pesticide components in the top-soil was conceptualized using a mixing layer model (McGrath et al., 2008; Joyce et al., 2010). This approach assumes linear equilibrium sorption and adapts McGrath et al. (2008) by directly accounting for the leached volume such that:"
